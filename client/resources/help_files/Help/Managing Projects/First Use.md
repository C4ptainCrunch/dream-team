# Creating a new project.

When creating a new project, a File Chooser pops up. Simply go to your desired parent directory and add the project name to the path.

# Importing a project.

You can either select a project that has been created/imported beforehand (and that will appear on the dropdown menu), or import the folder of a project someone else has given to you. 

# Renaming a project.

Chose a folder from the drop down menu, click rename, and enter the new name in the pop up box.
