# Creating a new diagram.

When creating a new diagram, a File Chooser pops up. Simply go to your desired

parent directory and add the diagram name to the path.

# Importing a diagram.

You can either select a diagram that has been created/imported beforehand (and that

will appear on the dropdown menu), or import the folder of a diagram someone

else has given to you.

# Renaming a diagram.

Chose a folder from the drop down menu, click rename, and enter the

new name in the pop up box.
